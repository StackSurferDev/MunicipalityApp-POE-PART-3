# Municipal Services Application

## Overview
The **Municipal Services Application** is designed to assist residents and administrators with managing local events, service requests, and issue reporting. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching events, monitoring service requests, and submitting new issues. The app utilizes advanced data structures to ensure optimal performance and seamless scaling as user and data volume increases.

### Key Features:
- **Event Management**: Allows users to view and create events, sorted by date.
- **Service Request Monitoring**: Users can submit service requests and track their status.
- **Issue Reporting**: Residents can report issues, which administrators can address.
  
The application uses several advanced data structures:
- **AVL Trees** for local event management, sorting them by date.
- **Binary Heaps** for prioritizing service requests.
- **Red-Black Trees** for dynamically changing data like request statuses.
- **Graphs** to handle dependencies between service requests.

## Project Structure

### Data Structures:
The project integrates the following data structures:
- **AVL Trees**: Used for organizing events by date. These trees ensure efficient insertion and retrieval, supporting quick event sorting.
- **Binary Heaps**: Employed for prioritizing service requests based on urgency. Binary heaps guarantee efficient priority management.
- **Red-Black Trees**: These trees manage real-time updates to service requests and allow for efficient balance and reordering.
- **Graphs**: Used for handling relationships and dependencies between different service requests.

### Technologies Used:
- **.NET Framework**: The application is built using the .NET framework, enabling smooth integration with various technologies and robust performance.
- **Redis**: An in-memory caching system for faster access to frequently requested data, such as event details and service request statuses.
- **SignalR**: Real-time communication for providing instant notifications to users about updates to service requests and new events.
- **Google Maps API**: Provides geospatial mapping functionality to display events and service requests on an interactive map.
- **ML.NET**: Implements machine learning to predict the priority of service requests, estimate response times, and analyze trends in service types.
